# Frontend High Severity Support Added

## Summary
Added "High" severity level support to all frontend dashboards and components to display Critical, High, and Medium severity findings.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/UserDashboard.tsx`)
- **Added import**: `AlertCircle` icon from lucide-react
- **Updated grid layout**: Changed from `lg:grid-cols-4` to `lg:grid-cols-5` to accommodate 5 cards
- **Added High Findings card**: New card displaying `findingsBySeverity['high']` count with yellow border

### 2. Admin Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)  
- **Added import**: `AlertCircle` icon from lucide-react
- **Updated grid layout**: Changed from `lg:grid-cols-4` to `lg:grid-cols-5` to accommodate 5 cards
- **Added High Findings card**: New card displaying `stats.findings.high` count with yellow border

### 3. Components Already Supporting High Severity
✅ **VulnerabilityAccordion** (`frontend/src/components/VulnerabilityAccordion.tsx`)
- Already has `high: 'bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 border-orange-400'` in severityColors

✅ **ScanDetails** (`frontend/src/pages/ScanDetails.tsx`)
- Already includes `high: 2` in severityOrder for proper sorting
- Already includes high severity in getSeverityCounts() function
- Already displays high severity in severity breakdown section

✅ **TypeScript Interfaces** (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`)
- Finding interface already includes 'high' in severity union type
- UsageStats interface already includes `high: number` in findings object

## Card Layout
The dashboards now display 5 cards in this order:
1. **Total Scans/Users** (Blue border)
2. **Critical Findings** (Red border) 
3. **High Findings** (Yellow border) ⭐ NEW
4. **Medium Findings** (Orange border)
5. **Last Scan** (Blue border)

## Visual Hierarchy
- **Critical**: Red border (`border-red-500`) - Most severe
- **High**: Yellow border (`border-yellow-500`) - High severity ⭐ NEW  
- **Medium**: Orange border (`border-orange-500`) - Medium severity

## Testing
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully with `npm run build`
- ✅ All TypeScript interfaces are compatible
- ✅ All existing components already support high severity
- ✅ Grid layout responsive on mobile (md:grid-cols-2) and desktop (lg:grid-cols-5)

## Backend Integration
The backend already returns "High" severity findings in the scanner response, so no backend changes are needed.

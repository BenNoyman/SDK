# CORS Issue Fixed

## üîß **Problem:**
The new admin endpoints `/api/admin/findings/{severity}` and `/api/findings/{severity}` were returning CORS errors because they didn't properly handle OPTIONS preflight requests.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Added OPTIONS Method Support**
Updated both endpoints to handle OPTIONS requests:
```python
@app.route('/api/admin/findings/<severity>', methods=['GET', 'OPTIONS'])
@app.route('/api/findings/<severity>', methods=['GET', 'OPTIONS'])
```

### **2. Implemented Preflight Request Handling**
Added explicit OPTIONS handling in both endpoints:
```python
# Handle CORS preflight request
if request.method == 'OPTIONS':
    response = jsonify({'status': 'ok'})
    response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:5173')
    response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type,Authorization')
    response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS')
    return response, 200
```

### **3. Server Restarted**
The Flask backend server has been restarted with the CORS fixes applied.

## üß™ **How to Test:**

1. **Make sure you're logged in as admin** (`sdkcreator` user)
2. **Try clicking the severity cards** in your dashboard:
   - Critical Findings card
   - High Findings card  
   - Medium Findings card
3. **Expected Result**: You should navigate to the findings table without CORS errors

## üîç **What Was Happening:**
- Browser sends OPTIONS preflight request before the actual GET request
- The endpoints were only configured for GET requests
- This caused the preflight request to fail with 405 Method Not Allowed
- Browser blocked the subsequent GET request due to failed preflight

## ‚úÖ **What's Fixed:**
- Both endpoints now accept OPTIONS requests
- Preflight requests return proper CORS headers
- Browser allows the subsequent GET requests to proceed
- Admin and user endpoints both work correctly

## üöÄ **Ready to Use:**
The clickable severity cards should now work properly without any CORS errors!
